  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>

I’m the man behind OG Concept. <br>To me, "OG" isn't just a name; it’s about being Original and staying Grounded.<br>

My professional life is a balancing act between two worlds. As a Correction Officer, I operate in a world of rules, security, and routine. <br>As a Graphic Designer, I operate in a world of color, imagination, and breaking boundaries.<br>

I started OG Concept to prove that you don't have to choose between being hardworking and being creative. <br>I bring the grit and dedication from my day job into every design I create. I understand that in both the facility and the marketplace, <br>your reputation depends on how you present yourself.

I’m here to make sure your brand looks sharp, stands tall, and commands respect.
